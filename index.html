				☛ "I leave behind me two things, The Quran and My Sunnah and if you follow these you will never go astray."<br><br>
				☛ “Do not wish to be like anyone except in two cases. The first is a person, whom Allah has given wealth & he spends it righteously; (the second is) the one whom Allah has given wisdom (the Holy Quran) and he acts according to it and teaches it to others.”<br><br>
				☛ “Feed the hungry, Visit the sick, Set free captives.”<br><br>
				☛ “Leave me as I leave you, for the people who were before you were ruined because their questions and their differences over the prophets. So, if I forbid you to do something, then keep away from it. And if I order you to do something, then do of it as much as you can.”<br><br> 
                ☛ “There will come a time when holding on to your Deen will be like holding on to hot Coals”<br><br> 
                ☛ “The strongest man is the one who, when he gets angry and his face reddens and his hackles rise, is able to defeat his anger."<br><br> 
                ☛ “The most excellent jihad is the conquest of one’s self.”<br><br> 
                ☛ “Verily, God is compassionate and is fond of compassion, and He gives to the compassionate what he does not give to the harsh.”<br><br> 
                ☛ "This world is a prison for the believers and a paradise for the non-believers."<br><br> 
                ☛ “When two persons are together, two of them must not whisper to each other, without letting the third hear; because it would hurt him.”<br><br> 
                ☛ “Verily, it is one of the respects to Allah to honor an old man.”<br><br> 
                ☛ “Kindness is a mark of faith, and whoever has not kindness has not faith.”<br><br> 
                ☛ “Four things support the world: the learning of the wise, the justice of the great, the prayers of the good, and the valor of the brave.”<br><br> 
                ☛ “None of you truly believes until he wishes for his brother what he wishes for himself.”<br><br> 
                ☛ “The ink of the scholar is more sacred than the blood of the martyr.”<br><br> 
                ☛ “Who is the most favored of God? He from whom the greatest good comes to His creature.”<br><br>
